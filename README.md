# Magnetic Stewardship Chamber

A lineage-safe, defense-in-depth control system for a magnetic resonance chamber that manifests QPPI via responsive magnetic fluid. Includes:

- Containment, lockdown, reconstruction consent
- Firewall + security relay, moving-target cryptography
- Multi-factor biometrics (QR DNA code, voice resonance, gestures/body analysis, finger-on-fluid print)
- Labyrinth shell game (compartmentalization, sharded secrets, decoys)
- Refresh protocol with automatic integrity sweeps
- Long-horizon testing and reliability simulation

## Quick start

### Firmware (TypeScript/Node)
- Requires Node 20+
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`

### Simulation (Python)
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install -r simulation/requirements.txt`
- `python simulation/stress_sim.py`

### Tests
- `npm run test`
